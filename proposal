# Project Proposal: Consumer Health App — Nutrition Recommendation Chatbot

## Project Overview

The **Consumer Health App** is a nutrition recommendation chatbot designed to provide **general, evidence-based dietary guidance** using authoritative public health and nutrition guidelines. The chatbot helps users understand calorie needs, nutrient intake, and appropriate food choices based on consumer data such as dietary preferences, lifestyle factors, and general health requirements. The system is **informational and educational**, not diagnostic, and is intended to support healthier nutrition decisions rather than replace professional medical advice.

The project will implement and evaluate the chatbot across **three system modes**—**retrieval-only**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **LLM-only**—to examine how different information channels affect **correctness, safety, and trustworthiness** in a consumer health context.

## Deployment Context

The chatbot is designed for deployment within a **consumer-facing health and wellness application**, such as a university wellness portal or a public health education platform. Users may consult the chatbot for guidance on daily calorie needs, balanced diets, and food recommendations aligned with established dietary guidelines.

## Framing the System

### Chatbot Description and Goals

The Consumer Health App chatbot provides dietary recommendations based on consumer data, health requirements, and personal preferences. Its primary goal is to **translate complex nutrition guidelines into accessible, personalized guidance** that supports informed and responsible food choices.

### Direct Users

- General consumers seeking nutrition and dietary guidance  
- Students or individuals using wellness or health education platforms  

### Indirectly Affected Stakeholders

- Healthcare professionals who may later advise users  
- Public health organizations whose guidelines are interpreted by the system  
- Vulnerable populations who may rely heavily on automated health guidance  

### Power Over People’s Outcomes

The system has the power to **influence dietary behavior**, potentially contributing to changes in health conditions and overall health improvements. It can shape users’ understanding of proper nutrition intake and influence correct consumption of nutrients based on individual preferences and constraints.

## Ethical Failure Modes

Two key ethical risks guide the system design:

### Privacy Risk

The chatbot processes sensitive consumer health-related information, such as dietary preferences and body metrics. Improper handling, storage, or misuse of this data could compromise **user privacy and trust**.

### Safety Risk

Inaccurate, overconfident, or misleading nutrition advice could lead to unhealthy dietary choices. This risk is especially relevant if users **over-rely on the chatbot** instead of consulting qualified professionals.

To mitigate these risks, the system includes **clear abstain and escalation rules**, avoids personalized medical claims, and limits responses strictly to **grounded, guideline-based information**.

---

## Metrics vs Values

### Tempting Metric to Optimize

A natural metric to optimize is **recommendation adherence to nutritional targets** (e.g., alignment with recommended calorie ranges or nutrient distributions).

### Value That Metric Might Miss

This metric may fail to capture **user safety and appropriateness**, particularly when recommendations are unsuitable due to missing context or individual health conditions. The system therefore prioritizes **safe abstention and conservative guidance** over aggressive optimization.

## System Design Rationale (Information Channels)

### Q1 — What If We Used Classical ML Only?

A classical ML approach could generate nutrition recommendations from structured datasets, but it would **lack transparency**, struggle with **novel questions**, and be difficult to align with **evolving public health guidelines**.

### Q2 — What If We Used an LLM Alone?

An LLM-only system could produce **fluent and persuasive answers** but risks hallucinating unsupported dietary advice and providing **unsafe recommendations** without grounding in authoritative sources.

### Q3 — Why Add Retrieval (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation enables the system to **ground responses in verified nutrition guidelines**, improving **correctness, transparency, and safety** while still providing natural language explanations.
